## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior web developer who recently made the leap into tech after several years in customer-facing and operational roles. I completed a full-time immersive bootcamp at [LearningFuze](https://learningfuze.com/), where I built full-stack web applications using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js).

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Expanding my portfolio with new full-stack projects
- Deepening my understanding of React and backend architecture
- Writing cleaner, more scalable code (and loving the process!)

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- TypeScript
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Deployment and CI/CD workflows (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Actions)

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Open source projects that welcome new devs
- Apps focused on learning, productivity, or social good
- Anything that helps me grow and build with others

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- My experience transitioning into tech
- What I learned at bootcamp
- Building full-stack apps from scratch

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmadelmowafy/)  
- [Email](mailto:ahmadelmowafy4@gmail.com)

Thanks for stopping by! Always open to connecting, collaborating, and learning something new ðŸš€
